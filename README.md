Fake news detection using NLP involves several steps. Here is a high-level overview of the process :


1.Importing and installing libraries:

Using pip install transformers datasets --quiet, install the necessary Python packages.

Import the necessary libraries, such as Transformers, NLTK, and TensorFlow.


2.Exploration and Data Loading:

Take the false and true news datasets (false.csv and True.csv) and load them into the program.

Create a single DataFrame (df) from both datasets.

Utilize Plotly to investigate and visualize data distribution.


3.Data preparation:

Datetime format conversion for the date column.

Stopwords and punctuation are removed during text data preprocessing.

Create training, validation, and test sets from the dataset.


4.Model Setup:

Define the mapping dictionary and class names.

the bert-base-uncased tokenizer should be loaded.

Use the BERT tokenizer to tokenize and encode text data for training, validation, and testing.

Make training, validation, and test sets for TensorFlow datasets.


5.Model Training:

Create a TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification BERT-based sequence classification model.

Utilize the binary classification metrics and Adam optimizer to build the model.

Utilize the training dataset to build the model, then use the validation dataset to test it.

ModelCheckpoint can be used to save the best model.


6.Visualizing Training History:

Use Plotly to see the training history metrics (loss, accuracy, precision, and recall).


7.Model assessment:

Use the test dataset to evaluate the model.

Loss, precision, recall, and accuracy of the print test.


8.Text Prognosis:

Create a function called "predict_text" that uses the trained model to predict labels for given text.

Pick five samples at random from the test set, make your predictions, and print your findings.
